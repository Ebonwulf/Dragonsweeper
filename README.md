This project has been an amazing challenge and is still a work in progress. Below is a list of all the features that will be added as I work them out and get them working;
* The option to flag a square
* Numbers surrounding the dragons based on how many are near by.
* Display the dragon count above the grid
* GET THE GAME WIN FUNCTION WORKING!
